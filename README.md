### Step Two - Steps to Run the project Locally ‚öôÔ∏è

Navigate to Project application.yml and modify the credential per your redis and Mysql database requirement.
```yaml
spring:
  cache:
    port: #redis-port
    host: #redis-host
    password: #provided password
    default-ttl: 180
  
  datasource:
      driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
      url: #Mysql-host
      username: #Mysql-username
      password: #Mysql-password
```
